        <h1>Carbon Footprint Calculator</h1>
        <p>Every time we turn on a light, drive to school, or throw something in the trash, we contribute to our <span class="highlight">carbon footprint</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="highlight">A carbon footprint</span> is the total amount of greenhouse gases (like carbon dioxide and methane) released into the atmosphere because of our daily activities.</p>
        <p>School events—whether a sports day, an annual function, or an art exhibition—also have a carbon footprint. The electricity used, food served or wasted, decoration used, and so on all leave an environmental impact.</p>
        <p>But what if your school could track and reduce that impact?</p>
        <p>Here’s WWF-India’s innovative <span class="highlight">Carbon Footprint Calculator for Schools</span>!</p>
        <p>This easy-to-use digital tool helps schools to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Plan a Carbon Conscious event:</strong> When planning your event, enter details and get an estimate of the emissions your event might generate. Plus, you’ll get simple, practical suggestions on how to cut the carbon.</li>
            <li><strong>Measure the impact post-event:</strong> After your school event, enter actual data to calculate the emissions produced and get insights on how to do better next time!</li>
            <li><strong>Earn recognition as a Climate Champion School:</strong> Schools that actively use the calculator to track and reduce their emissions generated at school events will be recognised by WWF-India as Climate Champion Schools.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By using this unique tool, your school can take impactful steps toward environmental responsibility and be part of the global effort for climate action.</p>
        <p>Host a Carbon Conscious school event and join WWF-India’s League of Climate Champion Schools today!</p>
